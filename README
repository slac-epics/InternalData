This module provides a way to connect EPICS PVs with the internal variables 
and waveforms of the user C/C++ program. It provides functions of:
- Automatic generate EPICS PVs for internal variables and waveforms
- Support identifying waveform record for input or output
- Automatic generate save/restore PV list
- Synchronize PV values with internal variables and waveforms
